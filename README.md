# Most_Dominant_Color
Here, I have made a project using K means Clustering Algorithm other then this the module that I have used here are:
1. Open CV to read the image .
2. NumPy and Matplotlib to show the color scaling according to their respective percentages of color
3. Used SkLearn to import Kmeans.
